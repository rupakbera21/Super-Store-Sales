# Superstore Sales: Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains a dataset representing the sales data of a global superstore over a span of 4 years. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of retail, and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) aims to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Overview

The Superstore Sales dataset spans 4 years of retail operations and provides a rich source for exploration. The analysis covers both univariate and bivariate aspects to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## Univariate Analysis

1. **Understand Dataset:**
   - Explore the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values and check for any anomalies in the data.

3. **Data Types:**
   - Check and ensure appropriate data types for each column.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate basic descriptive statistics for key numeric variables (e.g., sales, quantity).

5. **Histograms:**
   - Create histograms to visualize the distribution of key numeric variables.

6. **Time Series Plots:**
   - Plot time series graphs to understand trends and patterns in sales over the 4-year period.

7. **Seasonal Decomposition:**
   - Decompose time series data into components like trend, seasonality, and residuals for deeper insights.

8. **Box Plots:**
   - Use box plots to identify outliers and understand the distribution of numeric variables.

9. **Sales Distribution by Category:**
   - Visualize the distribution of sales across different categories using bar charts or pie charts.

10. **Sales Variation Over Time:**
    - Plot line charts to observe how sales vary over different time periods (months, quarters, years).

## Bivariate Analysis

1. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine the correlation between sales and other relevant numeric variables.

2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Plot scatter plots to explore the relationship between sales and another numeric variable.

3. **Pair Plots:**
   - Use pair plots for a quick overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.

4. **Category-wise Sales Trends:**
   - Analyze how sales trends differ across different categories using line charts.

5. **Heatmaps:**
   - Create heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix for better insights.

6. **Sales by Region:**
   - Compare sales across different regions using bar charts or stacked bar charts.

7. **Customer Segment Analysis:**
   - Explore sales trends for different customer segments using line charts or bar charts.

8. **Sales vs. Quantity:**
   - Investigate the relationship between sales and quantity sold using scatter plots.

9. **Customer Segment vs. Quantity:**
   - Compare the quantity sold across different customer segments using bar charts.

10. **Discount Impact on Sales:**
    - Analyze the impact of discounts on sales using bar charts or line charts.

11. **Shipping Mode vs. Sales:**
    - Explore the relationship between shipping modes and sales using categorical plots.

12. **Product-wise Sales Analysis:**
    - Investigate how sales vary for different products or categories using bar charts or line charts.

13. **Region-wise Product Sales:**
    - Compare product sales across different regions using grouped bar charts.

14. **Document Findings:**
    - Summarize key findings from both univariate and bivariate analyses. Highlight any notable trends or insights.

By following these steps, the analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Superstore Sales dataset, supporting business decisions and predictive modeling efforts.
